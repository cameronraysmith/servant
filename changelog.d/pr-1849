description: {
Servant provides facilities to work with streams of data. In this cookbook, we will be concerned
with serving infinite HTTP streams.

An infinite HTTP stream differs from a finite stream in two major ways. First, resource
cleanup is non-deterministic. Second, data must be sent back to the client regularly to prevent
the connection from closing. Both of these challenges are addressed in this recipe.
